The files are as follows:
•	Updated shapefile with emissions by source category , pollutant and LSOA, and accompanying metadata as a pdf document <Updated_LOSA_Deliverable>
•	Emissions for modelling with ADMS-Urban and Airviro <WestYorkshire_500mgrid>
•	Emissions for modelling with ADMS-Urban and Airviro  <WestYorkshire_500mgrid_T_a> (this file was created as there were issues opening the above file in 
               ArcMAP - something to do with sympbols, so this version has the symbols removed)


These files were sent in December 2023 (first 2) and January 2024 (last one)
